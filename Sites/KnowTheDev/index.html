          I'm Ecstasy, but I also go by Nix.
          I hopped into this community back in late 2017. Initially starting off in the RGH modding scene, where I hosted some modded lobbies for randoms on bo2. 
          But as I got deeper into it, I discovered programming and development, 
          and it felt like a playground with endless possibilities.
          Now, here's where things start to get interesting. One day, I was in an Xbox 360 party, and I got disconnected. 
          I couldn't help but wonder how that happened and how it affected my internet nothing was working as if my router was unplugged.
          So, I started exploring the DDoS community to satisfy my curiosity.
          I found a guy on Instagram selling a spot on a Qbot called 'YAZUZA' for $15-$25.
          I had an Xbox Live gift card sitting around and he was interested in trading so that's what I did. He asked for my login credentials.
          Then they hopped on my pc through Anydesk and shown me the ropes of sending attacks, pulling ups with 'Cain & Able'. 
          From that point on, I was hooked, and I started learning more about the structure behind botnets, how they worked, languages they were made in etc.
          The more I looked into it the more my knowledge on it just kept on growing and soon did my skills when I started playing around with some sources.
          I recorded some tutorials how to setup Mirai's, editied one and modified heavily which turned out to be the first the 'Beastmode' source which turned out to be a successful project.
          Cut to today, I've went into various projects and met two friends, 'Selfrep' and 'Aied,' who've been my partners in crime for years now. 
          Together, we founded 'AmG,' which stands for 'All members Goated'. 
          We've each carved our own paths. Selfrep's touched into game development, web development (backend), ethical hacking, freelancing etc. Aied's more into cybersecurity,
          Speaking of this man I remember when he was setting up Hilix while that mirai was still private haha god this was such a great era of this com before it was so toxic
          As for Selfrep, He has grown since the day he came to me asking me to help him setup a qbot source (we knew so little at the time, we all did).
          And for me, I've touched into some web development, learned some programing langs (python, batch, shell, C, golang and lua) to later start freelancing. (i never gotten too much into C as it wasn't my thing)<p>
        <p>
          That is my story of how I got into this community and what it looked like :)
